#Exercise 2: Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the file 
#and look for lines of the form: X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475 When you encounter a line 
#that starts with "X-DSPAM-Confidence:" pull apart the line to extract the floating-point 
#number on the line. Count these lines and then compute the total of the spam confidence 
#values from these lines. When you reach the end of the file, print out the average spam confidence. 
# 
#Enter the file name: mbox.txt
#Average spam confidence: 0.894128046745

#Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt
#Average spam confidence: 0.750718518519 Test your file on the mbox.txt and mbox-short.txt files.
